# objective
This projects aims at making a desktop application which performs CRUD functionalities on a student database preserving the authentication at the same time.
      
# description
->  An admin will have access to the database who can insert new records of the students,edit the records of particular students. he/she can simply see the details of a particular student by using an unique id provided to every student.

-> current admin can allow registrations of other admin. therefore two saperate tables are made ,one for student and one for admin.therefore registered admins can have access to this database.

# Scope
 This project is usefull for all the educational organization because they all need a system to manage student database.
 
# Technologies ,tool and software
 languages-> Python,MySQL.
 
 Tool-> Python IDLE 3.7
 
 software-> XAMPP software is used which provides Apache Web Server,mySql database server,php,perl all in one package.It is available for windows, Mac and linux.
 # XAMPP
 X->cross platform
 
 A->Apache server
 
 M->Maria DB(database server)
 
 P->PHP
 
 p->Perl
 
# Mysql
It is an open source software and a relational database management system.

# concepts used
->OOPS cocepts of Python( classes and objects based)

->code reusability(By importing file)

->library functions-> PyMySQL, Tkinter etc

   1.PyMySQL->In order to connect Python to a database you need a driver,which is a library used to interact with the database.
   
            we have such three driver choices - 1. MySQL
                                                2. MySQLdb
                                                3. PyMySQL
   2. Tkinter-> Its Python's standard GUI package. Pythom with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications.
   
                Two main methods- 1.Tk (To create main window)
                                  2. mainloop ( It is an infinite loop to run the application , wait for an event to occur and process the event till the window in not closed)
                
                It also offers-1. grid() method
                               2. pack() method
                               3. radio button , etc.
# Advantage
-> Desktop application

-> all the software are open source

-> Authentication is there.

# NOTE-> we need to start running this application from login page.
